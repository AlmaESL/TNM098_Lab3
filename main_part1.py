# TODO: compute the cosine similarity distance between all vectors 

# TODO: save results in a 12x12 matrix of cosine similarity distances

# TODO: use the matrix to rank the 11 images in similarity to one chosen image

# TODO: visualize the distance results from the ranking eg using a heatmap on pixel-by-pixel basis
